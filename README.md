App Idea: Task Tracker & Planner
I am thinking about building an app that combines a task tracker and planner. The app would allow users to:

Add, edit, and delete tasks.
Organize tasks by deadlines, priority, and project.
Set reminders for important tasks.
Sync across multiple devices.
View a calendar with scheduled tasks and reminders.
Share tasks with others for collaboration.
This app would aim to improve productivity by simplifying task management and planning, while also allowing users to collaborate with others on shared projects.
