### App Brainstorming:

#### Favorite Applications:
###### Instagram
* Allows us to see other people's lifestyle, share pictures and videos.
* We can like, comment, and share posts.
* Direct messaging is available for texting people.
###### Facebook
* Similar to Instagram, allows sharing and interacting with pictures and videos.
* Enables liking, commenting, and sharing posts with others.
* Texting feature is available as well.
###### WhatsApp
* Allows posting status updates and direct messaging.
* The best feature is the ability to lock the app or lock specific conversations to protect your privacy, so no one can read your messages.

### App Idea:
I would like to improve Instagram by adding a Profile View Feature, which would allow users to see who views their profile. This would give users more control over their interactions on the platform. Additionally, I would implement a Followed By Feature, where users can easily see who follows and unfollows them, providing better visibility and control over their followers. These features would enhance user experience and help manage privacy and interactions on Instagram more efficiently.
